## Problem Statement:
AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing electronics company, currently relies on Excel files for its data analysis, which hampers the ability to generate actionable insights. This lack of effective analytics has caused substantial losses in the Latin American market. The senior executives have decided to invest in a comprehensive data analytics project to improve decision-making and drive business growth.

## Goal & Purpose:

 - Provide an intuitive dashboard for tracking patient wait lists.
- Help administrators identify bottlenecks and trends.
- Assist in predicting future demand for healthcare services.

## Business Model:

This project could be leveraged as a subscription-based service for healthcare facilities seeking actionable insights into patient flow and wait list management.

## Feature Requests
Future improvements may include:
- Predictive analytics for wait time forecasting.
- Automated alerts for critical wait list thresholds.
- Integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems.


## Data Source
Data is aggregated from hospital records, patient management systems, and external healthcare databases.

## Data Modeling
Structured datasets are modeled using SQL and cleaned using Python (pandas). The data is then processed to generate insights used in dashboard visualizations.
